# Introduction

This vignette is for you if you need to extend mizer 
to meet the needs of your research project.
You will already have read the [main mizer vignette](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/mizer/vignettes/mizer_vignette.pdf) and thus be
familiar with what mizer can do out of the box.
You now want to implement the extension or modification of the
model required for your research, and for that you need to dive into 
the internal workings of mizer. This vignette is meant to make
that as easy as possible.

The first thing you should do, even before reading this vignette, is to
go to https://github.com/sizespectrum/mizer/issues and create a new "issue""
to share your ideas and plans with the mizer community. You may get back 
valuable feedback and advice.

# Preparation
In this section we describe how to set up your working environment
to allow you to easily work with the mizer code. Much of it you
may already have in place, so feel free to skip ahead.

## Installing R, RStudio

Mizer is compatible with R versions 3.1 and later.
If you still need to [install R](https://www.r-project.org/), simply install 
the latest version. 

This guide assumes that you will be using RStudio to work with R. There is
really no reason not to use RStudio and it makes a lot of things much easier.
RStudio develops rapidly and adds useful features all the time and so it pays 
to upgrade to the [latest version](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/preview/) 
frequently. This guide was written with version 1.2.830.

## The MizerParams object
An object of class 'MizerParams' holds all the information needed for the
'project()' method to simulate a model. 

## The MizerSim object

## Implementation of the model

### The size spectrum
The model framework builds on two central assumption and a number of lesser 
standard assumption.  

The first central assumption is that an individual can be characterized by its 
weight $w$ and its species number $i$ only. The aim of the model is to calculate 
the size spectrum ${\cal N}_i(w,t)$, which is the *density* of individuals of
species $i$ such that ${\cal N}_i(w,t)dw$ is the *number* of individuals of
species $i$ in the size interval $[w:w+dw]$ at time $t$. 

In the code the size spectrum is stored as an array such that `n[i, j, k]`
holds the density ${\cal N}_i(w_j,t_k)$ at a set of discrete weights $w_j$ and 
times $t_k$. Note that contrary to what one might have expected,
`n[i, j, k]` is not the *number* of individuals but the *density*.
The number of individuals in size bin $j$ is given by  `n[i, j, k]*dw[j]`.

The time evolution of the size spectrum is described by the 
McKendrik-von Foerster equation, which is simply a conservation equation:

\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:MvF}
  \frac{\partial N_i(w)}{\partial t} + \frac{\partial g_i(w) N_i(w)}{\partial w} 
  = -\mu_i(w) N_i(w)
\end{equation}

where individual growth $g_i(w)$ and mortality $\mu_i(w)$ will be described
below. 

This differential equation is approximated in mizer by a
finite-difference approximation (to be described in section ...). This
allows the `project()` method in mizer to project the size spectrum 
forwards in time: Given the spectrum at one time the `project()` method
calculates it at a set of later times.

### Predator-prey preference
The second central assumption is that the preference of food is determined by 
individual weight combined with a species preference. The preference of
an individual of species $i$ and weight $w$ for prey of species $j$ and
weight $w_p$ is assumed to factorize as $\theta_{ij}\phi(w_p/w)$ into
a species preference matrix $\theta_{ij}$ and a weight selection function
$\phi(w_p/w)$. Note that the assumption that the weight selection function
depends on the ratio of the predator and prey weights is central in mizer.

The choice of the function $\phi_i(w_p/w)$ is not central. By default it is set 
to the truncated log-normal function

\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:4}
  \phi_i(w_p/w) = \begin{cases}
  \exp \left[ \frac{-(\ln(w/(w_p \beta_i)))^2}{2\sigma_i^2} \right]
  &\text{ if }w/w_p\in\left[0,\beta_i\exp(3\sigma_i)\right]\\
  0&\text{ otherwise,}
  \end{cases}
\end{equation}
where $\beta_i$ is the preferred predator-prey mass ratio and $\sigma_i$ the 
width of the weight selection function.

The available food (mass per volume) for a predator of weight $w$ is determined 
by integrating over all species and the background resource weighted by the 
size selection function: 

\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:1}
  E_{a.i}(w) = \int \left( N_R(w_p) + \sum_{j} \theta_{ij} N_j(w_p) \right) 
  \phi_i(w_p/w) w_p \, dw_p.
\end{equation}

This available energy is calculated by the `getAvailEnergy()` method, which
uses Fast Fourier Transform to efficiently evaluate the integral for all $w$.

### Consumption

The food actually encountered $E_{e.i}$ (mass per time) depends on the search 
volume rate (volume per time):

\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:Ee}
  E_{e.i}(w) = \text{search_vol}_i(w) E_{a.i}(w).
\end{equation}

By default the search volume rate is assumed to scale with individual weight as 
$\text{search_vol}_i(w)=\gamma_i w^q$.

The encountered food is consumed subjected to a standard Holling functional 
response type II to represent satiation. This determines the 
\emph{feeding level}, $f_i(w)$, which is a dimensionless number between 0 
(no food) and 1 (fully satiated) so that $1-f_i(w)$ is the proportion of the
encountered food that is consumed. It is given by

\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:f}
  f_i(w) = \frac{E_{e.i}(w)}{E_{e.i}(w) + \text{intake_max}_i(w)},
\end{equation}

where intake_max is the maximum consumption rate.

The feeding level is calculated with the method `getFeedingLevel()`.
The maximum consumption rate is stored in the `intake_max` slot of the
MizerParams object and by default is initialised to 
`intake_max[i,j]`$=h_i w_j^n$, corresponding to
the above expression for the feeding level. However the value of
`intake_max` could be overwritten by something of the user's choice.

The rate at which food is
consumed is then $(1-f_i(w))E_{e.i}(w)=f_i(w) \text{intake_max}_i(w)$.

### Growth

The consumed food is assimilated with an efficiency $\alpha$ and 
used to fuel the needs for standard metabolism (at a rate $k_{s.i} w^p$) and 
activity and movement (at a rate $k_i w$). The remaining rate, if any,
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:Er}
  E_{r.i}(w) = \max(0, \alpha f_i(w) h_i w^n - k_{s.i} w^p - k_i w)
\end{equation}
is used for growth and reproduction. This is calculated with the 
`getEReproAndGrowth()` method.

When food supply does not cover the requirements of metabolism and activity, 
growth and reproduction stops, i.e. there is no negative growth.
The individual should then be subjected to a starvation mortality, but starvation
mortality is not implemented in mizer at the moment.

The proportion of $E_{r.i}(w)$ that is used for reproduction is given by
a function $\psi_i(w)$ that changes between 
zero around the weight of maturation $w_{m.i}$ to one at the asymptotic weight 
$W_i$ where all available energy is used for reproduction:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:psi}
  \psi_i(w) = \left[ 1 + \left( \frac{w}{w_{m.i}} \right)^{-u} \right]^{-1} \left( \frac{w}{W_i} \right)^{1-n},
\end{equation}
The default value of $u$ is $10.$ The term in the square bracket is a function that varies smoothly from 0 to 1 around the weight at maturation.  The last term describes how the relative amount of energy invested in reproduction increases as the weight approaches the asymptotic weight.  

Thus the somatic growth function is given by
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:growth}
  g_i(w) = E_{r.i}(w)\left(1-\psi_i(w)\right).
\end{equation}
