# Introduction

This vignette is for you if you need to extend mizer 
to meet the needs of your research project.
You will already have read the [main mizer vignette](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/mizer/vignettes/mizer_vignette.pdf) and thus be
familiar with what mizer can do out of the box.
You now want to implement the extension or modification of the
model required for your research, and for that you need to dive into 
the internal workings of mizer. This vignette is meant to make
that as easy as possible.

# Preparation
In this section we describe how to set up your working environment
to allow you to easily work with the mizer code. Much of it you
may already have in place, so feel free to skip ahead.

## Installing R, RStudio

Mizer is compatible with R versions 3.1 and later.
If you still need to [install R](https://www.r-project.org/), simply install 
the latest version. 

This guide assumes that you will be using RStudio to work with R. There is
really no reason not to use RStudio and it makes a lot of things much easier.
RStudio develops rapidly and adds useful features all the time and so it pays 
to upgrade to the [latest version](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/preview/) 
frequently. This guide was written with version 1.2.830.
